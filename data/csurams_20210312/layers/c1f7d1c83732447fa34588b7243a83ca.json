{"layers": [{"currentVersion": 10.81, "cimVersion": "2.6.0", "id": 0, "name": "Areas of Important Landscape Connectivity", "type": "Raster Layer", "description": "Non-species-specific omnidirectional landscape connectivity was modeled using Omniscape (McRae et al 2016; Landau 2020), an omnidirectional implementation of Circuitscape (McRae and Shah 2009). Circuitscape leverages algorithms from electrical circuit theory and their underlying mathematical connections with random-walk theory to predict ecological flows (e.g., species movement, gene migration, fire behavior, water flow) across complex landscape mosaics (McRae et al. 2008; Dickson et al. 2019). Applied in a raster data model, electrical current, representing the ecological entity of interest (e.g. dispersing individuals), is \u201cinjected\u201d into source pixels (e.g., source habitat patches or cores) and flows across a resistance surface to \u201cground\u201d (e.g., destination habitat patches or cores). Unlike approaches predicated on the identification of least-cost paths, circuit-theoretic connectivity models support quantitative evaluation of movement across multiple pathways. Input current can be modulated in accord with site characteristics conducive to outward flow (e.g., number of dispersers, relative habitat quality). Omniscape iteratively calls the Circuitscape code from a circular moving window to produce a cumulative, omnidirectional map of movement probabilities. With every iterative shift of the moving window, current is injected into every qualifying pixel relative to its source strength before flowing to ground at the circle's center target pixel. The final map, produced by summing the output surfaces from all iterations, quantifies the entire landscape's contribution to connectivity. In producing continuous models of connectivity in a framework free of discrete core areas, the omnidirectional approach avoids the need for assumptions in the delineation of core areas as well as high sensitivity of connectivity outputs to patch metrics. In addition to analytic advantages with Circuitscape (e.g., simultaneous analysis across multiple paths, variable source strength), Omniscape provides flexibility in specifying which conservation targets to connect and \u2013 by adjusting the search radius of the moving window \u2013 the maximum distances over which flows are to be permitted given the nature of the conservation target(s) and planning horizon. Both Circuitscape and Omniscape have been recoded into the Julia language for marked improvements in flexibility, scalability, and computational efficiencies (Anantharaman et al. 2019, Landau 2020). The initial output of raw current flow is the product of the amount and configuration of source flow available to connect within the search radius as shaped by intervening resistance. A second output of flow potential (a \u201cnull model\u201d) provides a baseline surface of the current flow expected in the absence of differential resistance. Flow potential is determined entirely by the amount and configuration of source flow available to connect within the search radius. A third, derived output is of normalized current flow. Calculated as raw current flow divided by flow potential, this surface helps differentiate the mechanisms behind different flow rates. In the context of connectivity conservation for terrestrial species, these rates are typically classified as follows: Impeded areas of restricted current flow are where human land use substantially limits movement potential. Diffuse areas, characterized by moderate yet widespread and largely unrestricted current flow, are indicative of many potential movement options through mostly natural lands with few and/or more isolated barriers. Intensified areas occur where higher resistances reduce the options for potential movement, increasing flow to levels higher than expected. Intensified flow often occurs where it begins to \u201cfunnel\u201d toward channelized areas. Channelized areas occur where barriers constrain and concentrate current to potentially a single movement option with flow levels much higher than expected. The term barrier in this framework refers to a feature or area in the landscape (anthropogenic and/or natural) with proximately high relative resistance. Barriers exhibit a dual nature: they effect pronounced reductions in immediate connectivity yet also contribute in giving rise to and shaping nearby intensified and/or channelized flow. Areas characterized by different flow rates and/or barriers may warrant different strategies for connectivity conservation. In maintenance of connectivity across diffuse areas, policy efforts affecting land use over large extents may be most effective. As flow intensifies into channelized areas, pinch-points begin to emerge. These areas are the bottlenecks at which broader-scale connectivity is most susceptible to being severed and which may deserve prioritization for targeted protection. Barriers are areas where habitat restoration may lead to the greatest improvement in landscape connectivity. This dataset, \u2018NM Importance to Preserving Landscape Connectivity', originated with an Omniscape.jl run using the original, 30-meter resolution version of the \u2018NM Human Modification' raster (Conservation Science Partners, Inc. 2016) for a resistance surface. Source strength was calculated as the inverse of the resistance layer, and flow was mapped up to 27 km (i.e., the search radius). The resulting normalized current flow surface was classified to retain only areas of channelized and intensified flow \u2013 both characterized in respect to their importance in preserving landscape connectivity. ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION VALUE DESCRIPTION 10 Critically important: Species movement channelized into a potentially single option. Landscape connectivity could be severed with the loss of a relatively small amount of dispersal habitat. 1 Highly important: Species movement intensified with reduced options for pathways. Most relevant in relation to nearby areas of critical importance. 0 Areas initially classified as diffuse or impeded with little to no localized importance to preserving landscape connectivity.
