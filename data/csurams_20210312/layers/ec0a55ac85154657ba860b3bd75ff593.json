Because this assessment is designed to support prioritization of land management strategies, risk to buildings is translated upstream to the origin of the post-fire flood hazard to those structures. Buildings in 500-year flood hazard zones with a depth of at least 6 inches from the FATHOM dataset are assumed to be exposed to flood risk. This dataset was developed for the Data Atlas component of the Statewide Natural Resources Assessment for the 2020 New Mexico Forest Action Plan. The Atlas was prepared principally for use in spatial prioritization of resource protection and restoration strategies over 2020 \u2013 2030 by the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) Forestry Division (Forestry Division) and its partners.
