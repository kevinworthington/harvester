{"layers": [{"currentVersion": 10.81, "cimVersion": "2.6.0", "id": 0, "name": "Risk to Small Diameter Timber From Wildfire", "type": "Raster Layer", "description": "This is an index of the expected volume of small diameter timber at risk of loss to wildfire. Small diameter inventory is assumed to be susceptible to 6foot flame lengths. Annual probability of wildfire with six foot flame lengths times timber volume is the risk to small diameter inventory. Risk has been rescaled to range between 0 (no risk) to 1 (most risk). This dataset was prepared for the Data Atlas component of the Statewide Natural Resources Assessment for the 2020 New Mexico Forest Action Plan. The Atlas was prepared principally for use in spatial prioritization of resource protection and restoration strategies over 2020 \u2013 2030 by the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) Forestry Division (Forestry Division) and its partners.
