Topography from national elevation dataset (NED) (Gesch, Evans, Oimoen, Arundel, 2019). Soils parameters from 100m soils dataset (Ramcharan et al., 2018). Landcover and vegetation parameter from LANDFIRE existing vegetation cover dataset (Reeves, Kost, Ryan, 2006). FFPI aggregated to watersheds upstream from assets in floodplain based on 30m 100-year FATHOM floodplain (Wing et al., 2017). Building footprints used to represent assets (Microsoft, 2018). Burn Severity Model: Linear canopy cover model, is the inverse of pre-fire LU/Veg parameter (see Excel) Affected Resources and Assets: Buildings in 100-year floodplain Notes: Downstream inundation can be modeled with flood hazard zones. Assumption needs to be made about 500-year floods or 100-year floods assumed following fire. [Currently using 100-year floodplain because its most conservative.] This dataset was developed for the Data Atlas component of the Statewide Natural Resources Assessment for the 2020 New Mexico Forest Action Plan.
