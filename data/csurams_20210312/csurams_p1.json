The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.

Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The &quot;Combined&quot; feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and &quot;local&quot; or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant &quot;GAP Status Code&quot; and global &quot;IUCN Category&quot; standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. Use constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making -Public health planning, research, management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</span></p></div></div>", "culture": "en-us", "properties": null, "url": "https://services1.arcgis.com/KNdRU5cN6ENqCTjk/arcgis/rest/services/USFS_RG/FeatureServer", "proxyFilter": null, "access": "public", "size": -1, "subInfo": 0, "appCategories": [], "industries": [], "languages": [], "largeThumbnail": null, "banner": null, "screenshots": [], "listed": false, "numComments": 0, "numRatings": 0, "avgRating": 0, "numViews": 28, "scoreCompleteness": 100, "groupDesignations": null}, {"id": "d306b602cbba481fb522619ff9a4235f", "owner": "nwrs_ryan", "created": 1590005253000, "modified": 1591477317000, "guid": null, "name": "Wells_NM_RG", "title": "Wells_NM_RG", "type": "Feature Service", "typeKeywords": ["ArcGIS Server", "Data", "Feature Access", "Feature Service", "Metadata", "Service", "Singlelayer", "Hosted Service"], "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>New Mexico water wells within the Rio Grande River Basin.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><br /></span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span>THIS OSE PODS DATASET IS ACCOMPANIED BY A SEPARATELY DOWNLOADED DATA DICTIONARY (METADATA).

Circuitscape leverages algorithms from electrical circuit theory and their underlying mathematical connections with random-walk theory to predict ecological flows (e.g., species movement, gene migration, fire behavior, water flow) across complex landscape mosaics (McRae et al. 2008; Dickson et al. 2019). Applied in a raster data model, electrical current, representing the ecological entity of interest (e.g. dispersing individuals), is \u201cinjected\u201d into source pixels (e.g., source habitat patches or cores) and flows across a resistance surface to \u201cground\u201d (e.g., destination habitat patches or cores). Unlike approaches predicated on the identification of least-cost paths, circuit-theoretic connectivity models support quantitative evaluation of movement across multiple pathways. Input current can be modulated in accord with site characteristics conducive to outward flow (e.g., number of dispersers, relative habitat quality). Omniscape iteratively calls the Circuitscape code from a circular moving window to produce a cumulative, omnidirectional map of movement probabilities. With every iterative shift of the moving window, current is injected into every qualifying pixel relative to its source strength before flowing to ground at the circle's center target pixel. The final map, produced by summing the output surfaces from all iterations, quantifies the entire landscape's contribution to connectivity. In producing continuous models of connectivity in a framework free of discrete core areas, the omnidirectional approach avoids the need for assumptions in the delineation of core areas as well as high sensitivity of connectivity outputs to patch metrics. In addition to analytic advantages with Circuitscape (e.g., simultaneous analysis across multiple paths, variable source strength), Omniscape provides flexibility in specifying which conservation targets to connect and \u2013 by adjusting the search radius of the moving window \u2013 the maximum distances over which flows are to be permitted given the nature of the conservation target(s) and planning horizon. Both Circuitscape and Omniscape have been recoded into the Julia language for marked improvements in flexibility, scalability, and computational efficiencies (Anantharaman et al. 2019, Landau 2020). The initial output of raw current flow is the product of the amount and configuration of source flow available to connect within the search radius as shaped by intervening resistance. A second output of flow potential (a \u201cnull model\u201d) provides a baseline surface of the current flow expected in the absence of differential resistance. Flow potential is determined entirely by the amount and configuration of source flow available to connect within the search radius. A third, derived output is of normalized current flow. Calculated as raw current flow divided by flow potential, this surface helps differentiate the mechanisms behind different flow rates. In the context of connectivity conservation for terrestrial species, these rates are typically classified as follows: Impeded areas of restricted current flow are where human land use substantially limits movement potential. Diffuse areas, characterized by moderate yet widespread and largely unrestricted current flow, are indicative of many potential movement options through mostly natural lands with few and/or more isolated barriers. Intensified areas occur where higher resistances reduce the options for potential movement, increasing flow to levels higher than expected. Intensified flow often occurs where it begins to \u201cfunnel\u201d toward channelized areas. Channelized areas occur where barriers constrain and concentrate current to potentially a single movement option with flow levels much higher than expected. The term barrier in this framework refers to a feature or area in the landscape (anthropogenic and/or natural) with proximately high relative resistance. Barriers exhibit a dual nature: they effect pronounced reductions in immediate connectivity yet also contribute in giving rise to and shaping nearby intensified and/or channelized flow. Areas characterized by different flow rates and/or barriers may warrant different strategies for connectivity conservation. In maintenance of connectivity across diffuse areas, policy efforts affecting land use over large extents may be most effective. As flow intensifies into channelized areas, pinch-points begin to emerge. These areas are the bottlenecks at which broader-scale connectivity is most susceptible to being severed and which may deserve prioritization for targeted protection. Barriers are areas where habitat restoration may lead to the greatest improvement in landscape connectivity. This dataset, \u2018NM Importance to Preserving Landscape Connectivity', originated with an Omniscape.jl run using the original, 30-meter resolution version of the \u2018NM Human Modification' raster (Conservation Science Partners, Inc. 2016) for a resistance surface. Source strength was calculated as the inverse of the resistance layer, and flow was mapped up to 27 km (i.e., the search radius). The resulting normalized current flow surface was classified to retain only areas of channelized and intensified flow \u2013 both characterized in respect to their importance in preserving landscape connectivity. ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION VALUE DESCRIPTION 10 Critically important: Species movement channelized into a potentially single option. Landscape connectivity could be severed with the loss of a relatively small amount of dispersal habitat. 1 Highly important: Species movement intensified with reduced options for pathways. Most relevant in relation to nearby areas of critical importance. 0 Areas initially classified as diffuse or impeded with little to no localized importance to preserving landscape connectivity.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The &quot;Combined&quot; feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and &quot;local&quot; or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant &quot;GAP Status Code&quot; and global &quot;IUCN Category&quot; standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

The U.S. Geological Survey and all contributing data partners and aggregators shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. Use constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making -Public health planning, research, management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</span></p></div></div>", "culture": "en-us", "properties": null, "url": "https://services1.arcgis.com/KNdRU5cN6ENqCTjk/arcgis/rest/services/FWS_RG/FeatureServer", "proxyFilter": null, "access": "public", "size": -1, "subInfo": 0, "appCategories": [], "industries": [], "languages": [], "largeThumbnail": null, "banner": null, "screenshots": [], "listed": false, "numComments": 0, "numRatings": 0, "avgRating": 0, "numViews": 21, "scoreCompleteness": 100, "groupDesignations": null}, {"id": "5fddc48810534819b246b42d1e5aa7cc", "owner": "jlc4_CSUrams8", "created": 1586360289000, "modified": 1587155673000, "guid": null, "name": "BT_NHDWaterbody", "title": "BT_NHDWaterbody", "type": "Feature Service", "typeKeywords": ["ArcGIS Server", "Data", "Feature Access", "Feature Service", "Metadata", "Service", "Singlelayer", "Hosted Service"], "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The &quot;Combined&quot; feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and &quot;local&quot; or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant &quot;GAP Status Code&quot; and global &quot;IUCN Category&quot; standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

The U.S. Geological Survey and all contributing data partners and aggregators shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. Use constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making -Public health planning, research, management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</span></p></div></div>", "culture": "en-us", "properties": null, "url": "https://services1.arcgis.com/KNdRU5cN6ENqCTjk/arcgis/rest/services/USBR_RG/FeatureServer", "proxyFilter": null, "access": "public", "size": -1, "subInfo": 0, "appCategories": [], "industries": [], "languages": [], "largeThumbnail": null, "banner": null, "screenshots": [], "listed": false, "numComments": 0, "numRatings": 0, "avgRating": 0, "numViews": 32, "scoreCompleteness": 100, "groupDesignations": null}, {"id": "65d4f08787dc4dc0bc07eed1ea690de1", "owner": "nwrs_ryan", "created": 1590006611000, "modified": 1591477173000, "guid": null, "name": "Dams_RG", "title": "Dams_RG", "type": "Feature Service", "typeKeywords": ["ArcGIS Server", "Data", "Feature Access", "Feature Service", "Metadata", "Service", "Singlelayer", "Hosted Service"], "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>Dams within the Rio Grande River Basin.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><br /></span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span>US: </span><span>This map layer portrays major dams on United States.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The &quot;Combined&quot; feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and &quot;local&quot; or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant &quot;GAP Status Code&quot; and global &quot;IUCN Category&quot; standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. Use constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making -Public health planning, research, management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</span></p></div></div>", "culture": "en-us", "properties": null, "url": "https://services1.arcgis.com/KNdRU5cN6ENqCTjk/arcgis/rest/services/PAD_RG/FeatureServer", "proxyFilter": null, "access": "public", "size": -1, "subInfo": 0, "appCategories": [], "industries": [], "languages": [], "largeThumbnail": null, "banner": null, "screenshots": [], "listed": false, "numComments": 0, "numRatings": 0, "avgRating": 0, "numViews": 28, "scoreCompleteness": 100, "groupDesignations": null}, {"id": "231cfe6399004a128a242a6a241d8fef", "owner": "benjamin.markle_CSUrams", "created": 1613419242000, "modified": 1613421010000, "guid": null, "name": "Risk_to_Standing_Sawlogs_From_Wildfire_", "title": "Risk to Standing Sawlogs From Wildfire_", "type": "Map Service", "typeKeywords": ["Data", "Service", "Map Service", "ArcGIS Server", "WMTS", "Hosted Service", "Metadata"], "description": "This is an index of the expected volume of sawtimber at risk of loss to wildfire.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The &quot;Combined&quot; feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and &quot;local&quot; or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant &quot;GAP Status Code&quot; and global &quot;IUCN Category&quot; standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data.

Use constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making -Public health planning, research, management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</span></p></div></div>", "culture": "en-us", "properties": null, "url": "https://services1.arcgis.com/KNdRU5cN6ENqCTjk/arcgis/rest/services/BIA_RG/FeatureServer", "proxyFilter": null, "access": "public", "size": -1, "subInfo": 0, "appCategories": [], "industries": [], "languages": [], "largeThumbnail": null, "banner": null, "screenshots": [], "listed": false, "numComments": 0, "numRatings": 0, "avgRating": 0, "numViews": 18, "scoreCompleteness": 100, "groupDesignations": null}, {"id": "8799485196374cb08186c0676019cf5d", "owner": "nwrs_ryan", "created": 1590117219000, "modified": 1591478722000, "guid": null, "name": "NPS_RG", "title": "NPS_RG", "type": "Feature Service", "typeKeywords": ["ArcGIS Server", "Data", "Feature Access", "Feature Service", "Metadata", "Service", "Singlelayer", "Hosted Service"], "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>United States National Park Service lands within the Rio Grande River Basin.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><br /></span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span>The USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public open space and voluntarily provided, private protected areas, identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastral Theme (http://www.fgdc.gov/ngda-reports/NGDA_Datasets.html). PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The &quot;Combined&quot; feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and &quot;local&quot; or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant &quot;GAP Status Code&quot; and global &quot;IUCN Category&quot; standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. Use constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making -Public health planning, research, management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</span></p></div></div>", "culture": "en-us", "properties": null, "url": "https://services1.arcgis.com/KNdRU5cN6ENqCTjk/arcgis/rest/services/NGO_RG/FeatureServer", "proxyFilter": null, "access": "public", "size": -1, "subInfo": 0, "appCategories": [], "industries": [], "languages": [], "largeThumbnail": null, "banner": null, "screenshots": [], "listed": false, "numComments": 0, "numRatings": 0, "avgRating": 0, "numViews": 18, "scoreCompleteness": 100, "groupDesignations": null}, {"id": "242f5196208f45e3a9e99985a3b79397", "owner": "nwrs_ryan", "created": 1589908788000, "modified": 1590870684000, "guid": null, "name": "RGB_FAOprc_Sep", "title": "RGB_FAOprc_Sep", "type": "Map Service", "typeKeywords": ["ArcGIS Server", "Data", "Map Service", "Metadata", "Service", "WMTS", "Hosted Service"], "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>Estimated precipitation of the Rio Grande River Basin, during the month of September.</span><br /></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p><span>Grid with estimated precipitation per month with a spatial resolution of 10 arc minutes.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete \u201cbest available\u201d inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The &quot;Combined&quot; feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and &quot;local&quot; or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant &quot;GAP Status Code&quot; and global &quot;IUCN Category&quot; standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

The U.S. Geological Survey and all contributing data partners and aggregators shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for guidance. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective. Use constraints: Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as the nation, a region or state (completeness in counties varies) or to provide context for finer-level maps. A general list of possible applications includes: -National, regional or statewide biodiversity planning, research, management, or policy making -National, Regional or state habitat conservation planning, research, management, or policy making -Outdoor recreation planning, research, management or policy making -Public health planning, research, management or policy making -County comprehensive planning -Large-area resource management planning -Coarse-filter evaluation of potential impacts or benefits of major projects or plan initiatives on biodiversity, such as utility or transportation corridors, wilderness proposals, habitat connectivity proposals, climate change adaption proposals, regional open space and recreation proposals, etc. -Determining relative amounts of management responsibility for specific biological resources among land stewards to facilitate cooperative management and planning. -Basic research on regional distributions of plants and animals and to help target both specific species and geographic areas for needed research. -Environmental impact assessment for large projects or military activities. -Estimation of potential economic impacts from loss of biological resource-based activities. -Education at all levels and for both students and citizens. Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate ones, however, there is a \"fuzzy line\" that is eventually crossed when the differences in resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include: -Using the data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. -Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition. -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic area -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature. -Establishing a measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data. -Altering the data in any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product. -Using the data without acquiring and reviewing the metadata.</span></p></div></div>", "culture": "en-us", "properties": null, "url": "https://services1.arcgis.com/KNdRU5cN6ENqCTjk/arcgis/rest/services/BLM_RG/FeatureServer", "proxyFilter": null, "access": "public", "size": -1, "subInfo": 0, "appCategories": [], "industries": [], "languages": [], "largeThumbnail": null, "banner": null, "screenshots": [], "listed": false, "numComments": 0, "numRatings": 0, "avgRating": 0, "numViews": 14, "scoreCompleteness": 100, "groupDesignations": null}, {"id": "71a9bee880b64ac9b4317930abcd2e4c", "owner": "nwrs_ryan", "created": 1589908192000, "modified": 1590869949000, "guid": null, "name": "RGB_FAOprc_Apr", "title": "RGB_FAOprc_Apr", "type": "Map Service", "typeKeywords": ["ArcGIS Server", "Data", "Map Service", "Metadata", "Service", "WMTS", "Hosted Service"], "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>Estimated precipitation of the Rio Grande River Basin, during the month of April.</span><br /></p><p><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><br /></span></p><p><span>Grid with estimated precipitation per month with a spatial resolution of 10 arc minutes.

It defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point except in coastal or lake front areas where there could be multiple outlets as stated by the &quot;Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)&quot; \u201cStandard\u201d (http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3/). Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit (6th level) for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. WBD line attributes contain the highest level of hydrologic unit for each boundary, line source information and flow modifications.", "tags": ["16-digit", "Hydrologic Unit Code", "Region", "US", "4-digit", "HUC", "United States", "Watershed Boundary Dataset", "2-digit", "Basin", "10-digit", "Hydrologic Units", "Sub-basin", "Watershed", "WBD", "6-digit", "inlandWaters", "Sub-region", "Subwatershed", "12-digit", "14-digit", "8-digit", "HU", "HU2", "rg_hydrology", "hydrology", "Rio Grande", "Rio Grande River", "Rio Grande Basin", "River", "water"], "snippet": "The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) for the Rio Grande River Basin, Hydrological Units 2.", "thumbnail": "thumbnail/thumbnail.png", "documentation": null, "extent": [[-109.02341555299996, 24.839491037000073], [-97.08857608699998, 38.458170249000034]], "categories": [], "spatialReference": "4326", "accessInformation": "Funding for the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) was provided by the USDA-NRCS, USGS and EPA along with other federal, state and local agenciesies.
